Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
This is a branch of engineering that deals with the development of software products.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Traditional programming refers to any manually created program that uses input data and runs on a computer to produce the output while


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
It is a structured process used to design, develop and test good-quality software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
- Planning and requirement analysis

- Defining of requirements
Here all requirements for the target softwares are specified. It is usually done through Software Requirement Specification(SRS) document consosting of all the product requirements to be designed and developed.

- Designing 
At this stage the SRS document is the reference and multiple designs for the product are created at this statge and documented in the Design Document Specification.

- Development
Here, the development for the product begins.

Testing
- The testing of the product happens at this stage. It consists of reporting product defects, fixing them, tracking them and retesting them till quality standards are met.

- Deployment
Once the product is ready, it is then released to the market at this stage.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
-In the waterfall model, the process of software development is divided into separate phases, and for each step to move to the next step, the previous step MUST be complete, they cannot overlap. In teh agile model, the tasks are divided into small time frames to deliver specific features for a release, all the builds are incremental in terms of features, the final build holds all the features specified by the customer.
Agile development is preferred when the project consists of a lot of developments, while the waterfall model is preferred when the project consists of a clear pkan without many developments.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
- Requirements engineering is a systematic and strict approach to the definition, creation and verification of requirements for a software system.
-Process
    Feasibility study
    Requirements elicitation
    Requirements specification
    Requirements verification and validation
    Requirements management
-Importance
    - It ensures that the software system meets the needs of all stakeholders.
    - It helps to identify potential conflicts and contradictions in the requirements, helping to reduce misunderstanding and errors.
    - Helps ensure the product is delivered on time and within budget.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is the breaking down of complex problems into more manageble sub-problems.
Moularity imporves maintainability since updates and bug fixes can be applied to individual modules without affecting the entire system.
Modularity improves scalability since modules can be scaled up or down easier without affecting the whole product.


Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
-Types of testing
    - Is a method of testing units or individual components of a software application
    - Integration testing -  Here different units are tested on how they interact with one another
    - System testing- This one evaluates the overall functionality and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution.
    - Acceptance testing -  This is a type of testing used to determine the compliance of the system with the business requirements and asses whether it's acceptable for delivery or not.
Importance of testing
- Helps ensure the product works properly
- Helps identify bugs and fix them before release.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
- Version control systems are tools used to help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Exapmles : Git, Apache subversion, Source code control systems, GNU Bazaar

Software Project Management:
Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
- Roles:
    Project planning
    Team management
    Risk management
    Quality assurance
    Progress monitoring and reporting
- Challenges
    Misalignment between gaols and business objectives
    Lack of accountability
    Rescource allocation


Software Maintenance:
Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
- Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with customer needs.
Types
- Corrective software maintenece - necessary when something goes wrong
- Preventive software maintenance - is done to prevent future errors or attacks on the product.
- Perffective software maintenance - is done when the need of new features as requested by users or the customer arises.
- Adaptive software maintenance is done so as to keep the product up to date with the policies and changing technologies.

Maintenance is essential as it enables the production of satisfactory products to the customer. It also helps the product to adapt to the changing times.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
- Ethical issues faced
    - Addictive design
    - Privacy
    - Data security
    - Data collection
    - Copyright concerns
